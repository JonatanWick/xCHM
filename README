 xCHM - the CHM viewer for UNIX

 * Prerequisites

 In order to be able to compile the code you need to have wxWindows and
 CHMLIB installed. You can get wxWindows from:

 http://www.wxwindows.org

 I strongly suggest you download the GTK+ flavour of wxWindows. If you
 can't do that (you might not have GTK+ installed), use the Xlib version.
 Only as a last resort use the Motif version.

 You can get CHMLIB from:

 http://66.93.236.84/~jedwin/projects/

 After you've installed the above you're ready for the next phase.


 * Installing

 Type ./configure --help if you're interested in parameters you can pass
 to configure for compile switches. Most people will be perfectly happy
 doing a:

 ./configure && make

 Once everything is built, type

 make install

 and the executable should be somewhere in your $PATH (hopefully :)).
 Now you can just type

 xchm

 and start your session.
 For bug reports and patches, please use the address above.
 For everything else, count to 10 and if you still want to send the
 message, go ahead. Can't promise I'll answer everything though.

 * Happy reading!
