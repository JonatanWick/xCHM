	* 0.5 is the initial release. It can load CHM files and display the
	homepage, print the displayed page, go back and forward in the
	history and toggle the contents tree panel. Enjoy.

	* 0.5.1. Minor modifications:
		+ added Doxygen comments and generated some documentation;
		+ added code to display the book's title on the titlebar,
		if the book's title can be determined.

	* 0.5.2. Minor bugfixes:
		+ corrected a path-related bug that happened when
		opening a CHM file who's default page was only a reference
		to a page in a different CHM file.

	* 0.6. Feature enhancements:
		+ added a custom selection font chooser dialog. Turns out to
		be a major feature as some (crappy) books display garbage
		with the default font.

	* 0.6.1. Major bugfix:
		+ fixed Unicode bug that prevented xCHM from compiling
		properly on RedHat 9. Many thanks go to Stefano Caselli
		for his aid and patience in testing the release candidates.
