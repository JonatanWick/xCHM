	* 0.5 is the initial release. It can load CHM files and display the
	homepage, print the displayed page, go back and forward in the
	history and toggle the contents tree panel. Enjoy.

	* 0.5.1. Minor modifications:
		+ added Doxygen comments and generated some documentation;
		+ added code to display the book's title on the titlebar,
		if the book's title can be determined.

	* 0.5.2. Minor bugfixes:
		+ corrected a path-related bug that happened when
		opening a CHM file who's default page was only a reference
		to a page in a different CHM file.

	* 0.6. Feature enhancements:
		+ added a custom selection font chooser dialog. Turns out to
		be a major feature as some (crappy) books display garbage
		with the default font.

	* 0.6.1. Major bugfix:
		+ fixed Unicode bug that prevented xCHM from compiling
		properly on RedHat 9. Many thanks go to Stefano Caselli
		for his aid and patience in testing the release candidates.

	* 0.6.2. Minor bugfixes:
		+ fixed references from a .chm file to pages in other
		.chm files (more MS-style petty stuff).
		+ applied PLD Linux configure patch and added
		--enable-optimize to the set of configure flags.

	* 0.6.3. Major bugfix:
		+ thanks to Vadim Zeitlin of wxWindows.org, fixed an endianess
		bug which prevented xCHM from working properly on big endian
		machines.
		+ changed the configure.in method to figure out where
		wxWindows is from plain old `wx-config --cxxflags`, etc.,
		to AM_PATH_WXCONFIG.

	* 0.7 Major feature enhancements:
		+ added a full search panel and changed the layout of the
		contents panel. Now you can look for text in all the pages
		of the loaded .chm file.

	* 0.7.1 Minor bugfixes:
		+ fixed bugs in the full document HTML search. 
		+ added a 'Search titles only' checkbox.
		+ the contents tree is now synchronized with the displayed
		document even if a document is not opened by selecting a
		tree item.
		
	* 0.8 Major feature enhancements:
		+ added bookmark support.

	* 0.8.1 Major feature enhancement masked as minor number release
		+ added real Microsoft-like $FIftiMain index-based
		global search. The searches are as fast as possible now.
